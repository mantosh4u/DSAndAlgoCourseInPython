# Every positive integer a is divisible by the trivial divisors 1 and a. The nontrivial
# divisors of a are the factors of a. For example, the factors of 20 are 2, 4, 5, and 10.
# Prime and composite numbers

# An integer a > 1 whose only divisors are the trivial divisors 1 and a is a prime
# number or, more simply, a prime. Primes have many special properties and play a
# critical role in number theory. The first 20 primes, in order, are
# 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71

# An integer a > 1 that is not prime is a composite number or, more simply, a 
# composite. For example, 39 is composite because 3|39.



# XOR:The XOR operator outputs a 1 whenever the inputs do not match, which occurs when 
# one of the two inputs is exclusively true.

# 0 XOR 0 = 0
# 0 XOR 1 = 1
# 1 XOR 0 = 1
# 1 XOR 1 = 0

# OR: The OR operator is also known as logical disjunction. It outputs a 1 whenever one or more of 
# its inputs are 1. Here is the truth table:
# 0 OR 0 = 0
# 0 OR 1 = 1
# 1 OR 0 = 1
# 1 OR 1 = 1
