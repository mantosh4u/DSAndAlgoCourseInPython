# In computer science, Prim's algorithm (also known as Jarn√≠k's algorithm) is a greedy algorithm that 
# finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the 
# edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the 
# tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an 
# arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree 
# to another vertex.
