# Lossless compression is a class of data compression that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed 
# from the compressed data with no loss of information. Lossless compression is possible because most real-world 
# data exhibits statistical redundancy.[1] By contrast, lossy compression permits reconstruction only of an 
# approximation of the original data, though usually with greatly improved compression rates (and therefore 
# reduced media sizes).


# In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code 
# that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding or using such a code proceeds
# by means of Huffman coding, an algorithm developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Sc.D. student at MIT, 
# and published in the 1952 paper "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes".[1]

# The output from Huffman's algorithm can be viewed as a variable-length code table for encoding a source 
# symbol (such as a character in a file). The algorithm derives this table from the estimated probability 
# or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the source symbol. As in other entropy 
# encoding methods, more common symbols are generally represented using fewer bits than less common 
# symbols. Huffman's method can be efficiently implemented, finding a code in time linear to the number 
# of input weights if these weights are sorted.[2] However, although optimal among methods encoding 
# symbols separately, Huffman coding is not always optimal among all compression methods - it is 
# replaced with arithmetic coding[3] or asymmetric numeral systems[4] if a better compression ratio 
# is required.



# Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of 
# two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs.[3][4] Morse code is named 
# after Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph. International Morse code encodes the 26 
# basic Latin letters a through z, one accented Latin letter (Ã©), the Arabic numerals, and a small set 
# of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns). There is no distinction between upper and lower case 
# letters.[1] Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dits and dahs. The dit duration is the 
# basic unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The duration of a dah is three times the 
# duration of a dit. Each dit or dah within an encoded character is followed by a period of signal 
# absence, called a space, equal to the dit duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space 
# of duration equal to three dits, and words are separated by a space equal to seven dits.[
